					<h2>Bolarinwa Komolafe - "the developer"</h2>
					Hi, 
                    <p>My name is Bolarinwa Komolafe and I am currently studying Computer Programming and Analysis Co-op Diploma
                        at Seneca College of Applied Arts &amp; Technology. My interests cut across web programming, database design and software development.
						Meanwhile, I am in the process of mastering the MEAN stack. Equally, I have a lot of exprience in metallurgy. Thus, I hope to use my programming knowledge for process 
						improvement and development. Also, I hope to become full-stack JavaScript developer and continue to learn and expand my experience to include all the amazing new dev tools, environments,
						 libraries, workflows and design methodologies available to the full-stack/MEAN developer community.</p>
                    <p>Enjoy browsing my app! If you have any questions, or are in need of a JS dev for your project, I can be found at <a href="mailto:bkomolafe@myseneca.ca" target="_blank">Bola</a></p>
                    Sincerely, <br/>
